## Mission
This year, we're going to do things differently. We are going to struggle, fail, succeed, and hopefully learn something along the way, together. There will not be tutorials every week on tools out there in the world, instead, we'll discover things along the way as a group.

This year, we're going to *attempt* to __build a weather application__, that will live on the DAES weather webpage. If you haven't been there in a while, or ever, there's probably a reason for that. And to be honest, if the reason is *"because its terrible"*, that's completely valid. As the rest of the weather world steams forward into the 21st century (and beyond), we don't want DAES to be left behind! Through this group effort, which __is not going to be easy__, we are going to (hopefully) create something useful!

## What
We're proposing to build a surface observation and reanalysis display portal. __Why__? If you take a look around, there are many great wesbites displaying forecast information (tropical tidbits, Alicia Bentley, Kyle Griffin, etc.) and a few great applications as well (earth.nullschool.net), but there seems to be a void when it comes to interactive displays of surface observations. Let's fill that void!

## Goals
We think this year's CG meetup will be successfull if 
1) you walk away at the end of the year feeling like you've been a part of a development team
2) you learn something new about a programming language you've used in the past, or never touched prior to these meetings
3) you make some new friends and have a few laughs along the way
